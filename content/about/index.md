I simulated black holes-neutron star mergers for the [SXS](https://black-holes.org) collaboration as a graduate student at [Washington State University](https://physics.wsu.edu).  These simulations involved using advanced numerical algorithms with the [Spectral Einstein Code](https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html) on high performance computing clusters using hundreds of CPU cores.
My undergrad was at [Grand Valley State University](https://gvsu.edu) where I studied physics and math.
I am also a professional chef. 

My culinary specialities are seafood and organic produce, although data suggests soups and sauces are my truer expression.
My most natural state is in a raucous, high-throughput kitchen. 
I'm fond of fermenting, pickling, brewing, smoking, and curing, as some things are just worth the wait.

I've been a [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) Linux user for a while, since `fc14`.
I enjoy tinkering with computers.
I have built and restored many, as well as home servers, cryptogrphic miners, an automatic CD ripper, and made various media projects involving computer parts sourced from atypical places, e.g., the [WSU Surplus Store](https://surplus.wsu.edu/). 
I have worked with every [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) board since their debute. 
I have a server that I practiced maintaining a [LEMP](https://lemp.io/) stack on.
This website shares only some of those capacities.

<details> <summary> <b> Even more thoughts.. </b> </summary>

As I closed out my academic life at the end of 2017, I found a different path, yet still evermore envious of all of the incredibly mindful people I got to know along the way.
I am forever grateful to call David Austin, Milun Rakovic and Matthew Duez advisors.
I enjoy teaching, working through the hardest problems, complex puzzles, reading, basically all of the things an academic does, but when I measured myself--my work ethic, imagination, drive--I never truly felt I had their same *gift*--I was a CPU living in a GPU world.
(It's worth noting that *gift* is not synonomous with 'less effort': archetypes in any discipline do not acheive without trying--you can't.  There are no *Will Hunting's* in this world.)
It's this nascent difference between life on easy mode and the ability to work with ease. 
The Italian word for this factor I admired in others academically, I've learned, is [sprezzatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura).  

>The only medium I've ever found myself to have experienced this nature, deep within, was with food, and maybe most of my accomplishments there don't exactly squeal *'gifted'*, but the way the processes clicks inside my brain is certainly *my* gift.

And so, with a fresher spirit, I began cooking in Northern California making delicious food with some incredibly amazing people.
I've been the **Executive Chef** of [*Dawson's Bar & Grill*](https://dixondawsons.com/) in Dixon, CA and [*Slanted Tree Kitchen & Taproom*](https://www.slantedtree.net/) in Fairfield, CA where I've served a variety of cuisines, delicious beer and wine pairings, and authentic farm-to-fork meals every night, both at the restaurant and at [Eatwell Farm](https://eatwell.com).

I recognize that there is a forever difficult access problem shared between STEM and culinary.  Cooking, coding, and calculating is all French to people, requiring a lot of will and patience, and a lot of suck.
This comes back to my marriage of food and computers: recipes, like code, as well as the creative process, must be as open source and open access as possible.
It continues to bother me that recipe histories, sourcing and revisioning have no navigable public ledger.

Part of this is emblematic of the food and beverage world itself, while also challenging is an oversaturation of information (in everything) to critical fatigue these days.
While we can follow recipes as well as journals, what we lack is structural tooling with respect to 

>
>$$food \in\\{ \textrm{culture}\\}$$
>

Something akin to sheet music, grammar structure, i.e., systems which let us experience flavor abstractly the way a musician hears melody, notes, through page, or how a writer masterfully articulates internal dialogue within her prose.

Useful for design, pictures and numbers alone fall short in the dynamic creative processes of all three cultural chambers.
What's unfair with food is the lack of an ability to construct our ideas visually in the *absence* of sensation.
Yet, it is enough for me to remain hopeful, that these modes of culinary structures can be discovered and made intelligable.
