# Biography

I simulate black holes-neutron star mergers for the [SXS](https://black-holes.org) collaboration as a graduate student at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu).  I did my undergrad at [Grand Valley State University](https://gvsu.edu) where I took as many physics and math classes as I could.  This website is a space to document some things about me and some things I do on computers.

I've been using Linux for about a decade.  I have a personal server that I practiced maintaining a [LEMP](https://lemp.io/) stack on before I tried giving a shot at making this static site.  I initially just wanted a place to host [my CV](/brege-cv.pdf), but I'm also using it to document some tips and tricks for computing.
