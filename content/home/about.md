# Biography

I simulated black holes-neutron star mergers for the [SXS](https://black-holes.org) collaboration as a graduate student at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu).  I did my undergrad at [Grand Valley State University](https://gvsu.edu) where I took as many physics and math classes as I could.  This website is a space to document some things about me and some things I do on computers.

I've been using Linux for about a decade.  I have a personal server that I practiced maintaining a [LEMP](https://lemp.io/) stack on before I tried giving a shot at making this static site.  I initially just wanted a place to host [my CV](/brege-cv.pdf), but I'm also using it to document some tips and tricks for computing.

Since wrapping up my graduate studies in 2017, I've been cooking in California making delicious food for real people.   I've been the Executive Chef of Dawson's Bar & Grill in Dixon, CA and Slanted Tree Kitchen & Taproom in Fairfield, CA where I've served a variety of cuisines, delicious beer and wine pairings, and authentic Farm-to-Fork meals every week, both at the restaurant and at [Eatwell Farm](https://eatwell.com). 

My belief in food and computers are similar: people should be able to know what they are consuming and see the guts of how it's done!  I am very interested in data driven approaches to food preperationa nd management as it applies in production as well as the home chef; science and systematic approaches have a place in the kitchen no diferent than food and beverage have a place at your desk.
