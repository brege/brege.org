### Tomato Jam

**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 2 Cups


#### Ingredients:

-   4 lb Tomato Scraps (no seeds)
-   1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
-   1/2 Cup White Wine Vinegar
-   tt Sallt and Cracked Black Pepper
-   1 packet Fruit Pectin (optional)

#### Directions: 

Quarter and remove the seeds from the tomatoes.
Roughly chop the seeded tomato and place in 6 quart sauce pot.
Add the vinegar, sugar and seasonings.
Place the proto-jam on the flat top grill for 1 hour.
Break down the tomatoes with a potato masher.
(Optional) Add the pectin and let dissolve for 10 minutes.
Cool in a 200 hotel pan in the fridge, then store in deli containers.

#### Notes: 

You can can this recipe but you will need a pressure canner due to the
increased risk of botulism in tomato canning. In our use we simply store
the jam fresh.
