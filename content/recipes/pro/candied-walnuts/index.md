## Candied Walnuts

**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 3 Quarts 

### Ingredients:

- 2 Quart Walnuts, halves and pieces
- 3 Cup Brown Sugar
- Â¾ Cup Water
- 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt

### Directions:

1.  In a large non-stick saute pan, bring all ingredients to a simmer
    until the syrup has begun to caramelize\
    \
    Be sure to do this on low heat, flipping occasionally. You want the
    caramel to completely coat the walnuts until they are sticky.

2.  Transfer to an oiled sheet tray. When the Walnuts have cooled, break
    them apart by hand and store in an appropriate container.
