## Parsnip Puree

**Chef:** Wyatt Brege



### Ingredients:

-   5 ea Parsnip
-   Heavy Cream
-   tt Salt

### Directions: 

Peel parsnips and dice to 1/2 inch sizes.
In a small 2 quart stock pot, add parsnips and poor Heavy Whipping Cream
into to the pot so the parsnips are fully submerged.
Cook on low heat until parsnips can be crushed easily with a metal
spoon.
Blend the parsnips and cream into a puree with a blender and ladle, food
processor, or an immersion blender.
Season with salt.

### Notes: 

Poaching the parsnips in cream (or milk) ensures that the puree comes
out bright white.

You may need to use some additional cream to assist in pureeing. This is
easiest when the parsnips and cream are still hot. Do not use a Magic
Bullet with hot parsnips as the pressure can be quite harmful.
