## Hollandaise

**Author:** Matt Andrews, Wyatt Brege

### Ingredients:

-   1 Cup Egg Yolks
-   1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
-   1 Tbsp White Wine
-   1 1/2 Pound Butter (melted)
-   tt Old Bay Seasoning (Standard)

### Directions: 

Whisk egg yolk, white wine, and lemon juice over a double boiler until
thickened to proper consistency. Be sure to not over heat the egg
mixture, as it can scramble and produce flan.

Slowly add in butter, assure you don\'t add it too quickly or it will
break.

If too thick add a small amount of hot water.

Once the hollandaise has formed, season with Old Bay.
