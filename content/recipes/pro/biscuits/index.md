## Biscuits

**Author:** Wyatt Brege, Patty Pereira

**Yield:** 1 full sheet (12 ea XL biscuits) 

### Ingredients:

- 1 Quart Organic Flour
- 2 Tbsp Baking Powder
- 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt
- ½ Pound Cold Raw Butter, 1" cubed
- 1+ Cup Barista Whole Milk (not raw)

### Directions:

1.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients until
    thoroughly combined

2.  Combine the dry mix and cold butter to the stand mixer bowl with the
    spade beater attachment, and gently knead until the mixture has
    resembled crumbs

3.  Slowly add milk, you may need more or less than one cup, just until
    the dough is smooth. Do not overwork the dough

4.  On a floured surface, roll out the dough, and tri-fold laminate.
    Repeat one more time until the sheet is roughly ½" thick

5.  Use the 3" circle cutter to make the biscuit forms, and place on a
    slip screen protected sheet tray, 1" apart from one another

6.  In a 350 deg F convection oven, bake for roughly twenty minutes

### Notes:

-   There will be dough scraps from the cutting practice that should be
    combined and rolled out to form more biscuits
