## Cajun Roasted Red Pepper Sauce

**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 2 Quart


### Ingredients:

-   12 each Large Red Bell Pepper
-   2/3 Cup House Cajun Seasoning
-   1/4 Cup Vegetable Stock

### Directions: 

Roast the red bell peppers on the six burners until the skins are
blackened, but not until they turn to white ash.

Place a colander in the bottom of the sink and clean the roasted peppers
under cold running water, removing the blackened skins, the interior
seeds, and the stem portion.

Place the roasted red pepper flesh in the blender with the stock and
Cajun seasoning, then puree for 60 seconds.

Store in 1 Quart deli containers and/or large squeeze bottles.
