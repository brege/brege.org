### House Chili

**Author:** Wyatt Brege, Viktor Sanchez



#### Ingredients:

-   2 each Red Bell Pepper (small dice)
-   2 each Green Bell Pepper (small dice)
-   2 each Large Yellow Onion (diced)
-   2 pounds Tomatoes (4x5 or cherry)
-   1/2 Cup Garlic, chopped
-   3 pounds Ground Beef (81/19 grind)
-   1/2 Cup Ground Cumin
-   1 Cup Chili Powder
-   1 each #10 can Black Beans, rinsed
-   5 pounds Pinto Beans, dried
-   2 ounce Onion Powder
-   1/4 Cup Paprika
-   6 each Bay Leaves
-   1/2 Cup Oregano, dry

#### Directions: 

Hydrate the pinto beans by cooking them in water for at least one hour.

In the rondeau, saute and lightly season with salt bell peppers and
onions until soft. Add the tomatoes and garlic and bring to a simmer.
Add the ground beef and cook through, breaking up any large clumps along
the way.

Add the cooked pinto beans, their juices, and rinsed black beans to the
bolognese. Season with spices and reduce for 5-10 minutes, until all
ingredients achieve an even viscosity.

Season with salt and fine black pepper.

#### Notes: 

Chili is a great soup for using up ingredients left over from tacos like
ground beef, diced tomatoes and onions, over-ripened tomatoes, black
beans nearing volatility and other cuts of neutrally cooked beef.
