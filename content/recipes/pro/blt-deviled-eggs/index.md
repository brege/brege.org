## B.L.T. Deviled Eggs

**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 15 servings


### Ingredients:

-   30 Egg Yolks
-   1 Cup Mayonaisse
-   3 Tbsp Lemon Juice
-   1 handful Baby Spinach, Fresh
-   1 ea Shallot, bruinoisse
-   1 Tbsp Honey Dijon Mustard
-   1 tsp Kosher Salt
-   1 tsp Fine Black Pepper

### Directions: 

Bring 30 eggs to a rolling boil, then remove pan from heat.
Let eggs stand in hot water for 13 minutes.
Cool quickly with ice and cold water.
Peel eggs.
Slice eggs in half lengthwise and separate egg yolks and whites in two
different bowls.
Bathe egg whites in water and a little lemon juice. Discard any broken
egg whites.
Carefully organize the egg whites on a toweled half sheet tray.

For the egg filling, puree the yolks, seasonings, lemon juice and
spinach in the food processor for 90 seconds.
Add the mayonnaise and shallots and puree for an additional 10-15
seconds \-- be careful not to over puree the mayonnaise as the filling
will become decidedly runny.
Store in piping bag with excess plastic and string removed.

Garnish with candied bacon and cherry tomato slivers (quartered
lengthwise).

### Notes: 

For the candied bacon, heat 1 cup chopped bacon in a saute pan until its
fat starts to glisten. Add 1/4 Cup of brown sugar and simmer on low heat
until the caramel crystallizes the bacon.
