**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 4 Quart


### Ingredients

-   5 pounds Tamatillo
-   4 each Garlic Cloves
-   5 each Jajapeno
-   tt Salt and Black Pepper
-   tt Ground Cumin

### Instructions 

Peel and wash the tamatillos. Roast them with the jalapenos in a cast
iron until soft.

Puree all ingredients but the cumin in the Ninja blender attachment
until smooth.

At the end, lightly add the cumin to desired taste. (You do not want it
to be powerful like chili or ranchero sauce, but subtle for a little
extra depth.)
