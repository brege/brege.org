A collection of professional, heirloom, and personal recipes, as well as tasting menus.

## [General / Home Recipes](/recipes/gen)

These recipes are meant for at home, personal, and camping use.  These will come in due time as I recreate and digitize my past notes.

## [Tasting Menus](/recipes/menus)

An archive of the tasting menus / farmer's market / farm-to-fork / CSA popup menus I did for *Dawson's* and *The Slanted Tree*.

## [Production Recipes](/recipes/pro)

These recipes are for a production kitchen. The quantities are much larger than what is appropriate for home use. These are speed recipes in the sense the user knows their way around their equipment, and has familiarized themselves with industry terminology.
