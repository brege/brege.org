**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 2 1/2 Quart


### Ingredients

-   4 ea Green Cabbage, Large
-   tt Salt

### Instructions 

Sanitize a large mixing bowl, chef knife, cutting board, 8-Quart
container, Cambro 1/6 pan lid, and a clean deli container and lid with
sanitizer water.

Wash hands and forearms thoroughly.

Shred the cabbage but discard the hearts. After each half-head of
cabbage cut, add to mixing bowl and sprinkle generously with kosher
salt. Continue until all cabbage is processed.

Thoroughly massage the cabbage for 10-25 minutes (depending on arm
strength).

Put the massaged cabbage in the bottom of the 8-Quart container.
Strongly press the cabbage down. Add the cabbage juice. Ensure none of
the solids are breaking the liquid surface.

Press the cabbage down with the Cambro lid and be sure to have about 1\"
of the natural brine covering the cabbage surface. Fill the deli with
sanitizer water and secure its lid to weigh down the 1/6 pan lid.

Cover the 8-Quart with cheesecloth and secure with wine.

Fill a 200 pan half full with water and place the 8-Quart in there.

Place the apparatus in a cool, dry place away from any possible falling
debris.

Store for 4-7 days, then condense into deli containers, with the brine.

### Notes 

Check progress of the kraut every day. Be sure to sanitize utensils used
to sample it. It is okay for some natural bloom, or foaming to occur on
the surface\-\--this is the fermentation process and shows that the
*lactobacillica* is breaking down the cabbage\-\--but if the cabbage
comes in contact with air, it will oxygenate and spoil. If the brine
evaporates quickly, which can cause this, add cool salt water (3%
salinity) to the existing brine to keep kraut submerged.

The hotel pan with water is a way of moderating fluctuations in
temperature of the kraut between day and night.
