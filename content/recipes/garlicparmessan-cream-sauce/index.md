### Ingredients

-   1/2 Gallon Heavy Wipping Cream
-   1/2 Cup All-Purpose Flour
-   1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter
-   2 Cup Grated Parmessan
-   1/3 Cup Pureed Garlic Confit
-   1/2 Tbsp Fine Black Pepper
-   1 Tbsp Kosher Salt

### Instructions 

Melt Butter in a 4 Quart pot over medium-high heat.
Whisk in flour to create a blonde roux.
Add 1/3 of cream to the roux and thicken.
Add 1/3 of cream and bring up to heat.
Add the Parmesan and garlic puree.
Add remaining 1/3 of cream and bring up to temperature.
Season with salt and pepper and place in a Baine-Marie insert.

### Notes 

To make the pureed garlic confit, bring a quart of peeled garlic cloves
to a simmer in olive or salad oil for 30-45 minutes. You want the garlic
to remain quite blonde but soft. Strain the garlic from the oil. Let oil
cool and place in squeeze bottle for plating red meats. Blend the garlic
into a puree with a blender and ladle, food processor, or an immersion
blender. You may need to use some of the oil to assist in pureeing. This
is easiest when the garlic is still hot. Do not use a Magic Bullet with
hot garlic confit as the pressure can be quite harmful.
