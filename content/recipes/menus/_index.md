An archive of the tasting menus / farmer's market / farm-to-fork / CSA popup menus I did for *Dawson's* and *The Slanted Tree*.

Many of the early cocktails were handcrafted by expert mixologist Jesse Flores, while others were created through invitations extended to over a dozen bartenders I had the pleasure of working with.
Desserts were almost entirely executed by pastry chef's Patty Pereira and Natalie Mertz. 

*Not included:* dinners on the farm, holidays, most special events and pairing dinners, main dinner/brunch/etc. menus.
