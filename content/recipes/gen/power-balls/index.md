### Power Balls

**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 9 servings (18 balls)

*An easy no-bake protein ball recipe with the protein of an egg white and the fiber of half an apple.*

#### Ingredients:

- 2 C Old-Fashioned Oats
- 2 30g Scoop of Vanilla-flavored Protein Powder (I use Aldi's)
- 2 Tbsp Cocoa Powder
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp Kosher Salt
- 1-2 Tbsp Honey *or* Maple Syrup
- 1/4 Cup Apple Sauce
- 2 Tbsp No-stir Peanut Butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 C [*optional*] Shreded Coconut, Crushed Nuts, or Granola (for coating or crunch)
- 2 Tbsp [*optional*] Flax Seed, ground

#### Directions:

1. Mix the first 7 dry ingredients, then add remaining wet ingredients, pressing with either
    a wooden pestle, spoon, or, ideally, a plastic dough scraper
2. Optionally add 1/4-1/2 C granola or nuts (as final mixing step) to dough for nougat-like crunch
3. Roll ~2 fl oz of dough into balls
4. Optionally, roll the balls in 1/4 C shredded coconut or equivalent
5. Store inthe fridge for up to one week

#### Notes:

- If you want a dryer protein ball, use coconut or maple sugar in place of honey or maple syrup
- **Substitution:** apple sauce ↔ ripe banana
- **Substitution:** peanut butter ↔ almond butter
- **Substitution:** vanilla protein powder ↔ chocolate protein powder
- Never be afraid to adjust oats if the mixture is too wet
