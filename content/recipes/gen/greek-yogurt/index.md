## Greek Yogurt

**Chef:** Wyatt Brege  

**Yield:** 1 quart

### Ingredients:

- 1/2 Gallon Whole Milk, expiring
- 1/2 Cup Greek Yogurt

### Directions:

1. Bring the milk up to 161 degrees F (79 degrees C) for 15 seconds if unsure of origin, then let cool to blood temperature, 100 degrees F (38 degrees C). USDA approved is generally safe to use as is.
2. Stir in the Greek yogurt, then pitch into a plastic tub or crock.  Glass can effect temperature greatly under draft.
3. Let sit in a warm place for 15-24 hours with a secured cloth, or whenever it solidifies.
4. In a large, sanitized mixing bowl, place a 36"x36" flour cloth over the bowl completely draping over the side. 
5. Poor in the yogurt over the cloth.  Prepare a long length of twine.  Bring the corners of the cloth to a point and tie tightly and securely.  
6. Suspend the yogurt pouch over the bowl by fastening it to a hook in the cieling.  Alternatively, use the colander and deep stock pot you use for spaghetti noodles, and let the secured pouch sit well over the seiving liquid whey.  You don't want the yogurt to touch the whey water.  You want it to dry out.
7. Let sit overnight in a dry place.  If you have pets, lower or remove the racks from your room temperature oven to store the aparatus.
8. Pasteurize the whey water for storage or discard.
9. Sperate the yogurt from the cloth into a clean tub and store.

### Notes:

- The whey water can be reduced to less the 1/4 of its original volume (from about 1 Quart to 3/4 Cup) into a spreadable caramel called **myost** in Skandinavian countries.  You can also use it in homemade bread, reheating chili or soup, marinading chicken for fried chicken, or as a starter for lacto-fermented vegetables.  Quite sour, this is not suitable for protein shakes.
