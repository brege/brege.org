**Author:** Wyatt Brege

**Yield:** 6 servings


### Ingredients

-   6 each 10 oz Boneless Beef Short Ribs
-   1 each Yellow Onion
-   12 fl oz Guiness or Dark Stout/Porter Beer
-   32 fl oz Vegetable Stock
-   1/4 Cup House Demi Glase
-   tt Salt and Course Black Pepper

### Instructions 

Season the short ribs with salt and black pepper, then sear off all six
sides on the flat top grill.

In a roasting tray or (400 or 600) 1/2 hotel pan, add the remaining
ingredients and bring to a boil.

Cover with aluminum foil and braise for 2.5 hours in a 425 deg oven.

### Notes 

To make the house demi glase, boil 2 pounds of connective tissue scraps
from processing the teres major beef muscle, tomato and mushroom scrap,
and 1 gallon vegetable stock and reduce by half. Puree this goulash in
the Ninja blender attachment (the connective tissue binds up the blade
on the immersion blender), then sieve through the chinois. Discard the
puree and slowly reduce the liquid to a demi glase.
