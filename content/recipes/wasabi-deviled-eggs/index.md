### Ingredients

-   30 Egg Yolks
-   4 Tbs Wasabi Paste
-   1/4 C Rice Wine Vinnegar
-   2 Tbs Lemon Juice
-   2 Tbs Mirin
-   1 C Mayonaise
-   1 tsp Salt

### Instructions 

Bring 30 eggs to a rolling boil, then remove pan from heat.
Let eggs stand in hot water for 13 minutes.
Cool quickly with ice and cold water.
Peel eggs.
Slice eggs in half lengthwise and separate egg yolks and whites in two
different bowls.
Bathe egg whites in water and a little lemon juice. Discard any broken
egg whites.
Carefully organize the egg whites on a toweled half sheet tray.
With gloves, thoroughly massage the yolks.
Add remaining ingredients and smooth with masher.
Scoop the mixture into a piping bag.

### Notes 

If starting from dry wasabi powder, incrementally reconstitute the
powder in a clean bowl with cold water until you can form a soft cube
with your fingers from the paste. Place in container removing any air
pockets and cover the surface with lemon juice to prevent browning.
