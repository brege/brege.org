  - Total Time:  15 mins

**Ingredients:**

* 4 bunch Basil
* 8-10 clove Peeled Garlic
* 2 1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 1/4 Cup Seasonal Tree Nuts (shelled whole)
* 1/4 Cup Grated Parmesan
* tt Salt and Black Pepper

**Directions:**

1. Remove any wilted leaves or hearty stems from the basil.  You do not need to remove all stems.
2. In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine the ingredients (but not parmesan) with the blender.  
3. Fold in the parmesan.

Notes:

* Four bunches of basil is roughly 8 oz.
* This is a rather loose pesto.  More parmesan cheese can be added to thicken.
